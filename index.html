  MILK, OR EMULSIONS.
In the perfumery trade, few articles meet with a more ready sale than that class of cosmetiques denominated milks. It has long been known that nearly all the seeds of plants which are called nuts, when decorticated and freed from their pellicle, on being reduced to a pulpy mass, and rubbed with about four times their weight of water, produce fluid which has every analogy to cow's milk. The milky appearance of these emulsions is due to the minute mechanical division of the oil derived from the nuts being diffused through the water. All these emulsions possess great chemical interest on account of their rapid decomposition, and the products emanating from their fermentation, especially that made with sweet almonds and pistachios (Pistachia vera).

In the manufacture of various milks for sale, careful manipulation is of the utmost importance, otherwise these emulsions "will not keep;" hence more loss than profit.

"Transformation takes place in the elements of vegetable caseine (existing in seeds) from the very moment that sweet almonds are converted into almond-milk."â€”Liebig. This accounts for the difficulty many persons find in making milk of almonds that does not spontaneously divide, a day or so after its manufacture.

    Country hides are of three grades, Ohio Buffs, Ohio Ex., and Southern. The Ohio Buffs weigh from forty to sixty pounds. The Ohio Ex. weighs from twenty to forty pounds. Southern hides have spots without hair and other blemishes on them, due to the sting of insects. This makes the Southern hide inferior to the Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Chicago hides that have no such blemishes. Ohio Butt hides are the best, because in Ohio they kill a great many young calves, while in Chicago young cows (that have calved) are killed, causing the hide to be flanky.
